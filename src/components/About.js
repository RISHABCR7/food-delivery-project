        <p>On the footprints of logistics, both the founders wanted something in the food industry which was related to technology and operational offline as well. 14th August 2014 was the date of inception for Swiggy, a dream project turned into reality by Harsha and Reddy. Swiggy was Indiaâ€™s first online food ordering and delivering platform.

          Both of these co-founders reached out to Rahul Jaimini to do the coding of the website and mobile app and welcomed him as a co-founder in Swiggy.
